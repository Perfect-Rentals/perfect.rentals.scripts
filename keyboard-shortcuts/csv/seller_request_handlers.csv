"request-email-offer","I'd love to do that; unfortunately it's company policy that we can't just leave open offers floating out there. We are looking at dozens of houses every day. Therefore, I am required to send you the written offer and review it TOGETHER to make sure that I can answer all of your questions and make sure you are 100% comfortable with everything."
"def-balloon","On or before the end of the agreed upon term, we'll pay you the remainder of what is owed on the property in a single \"balloon\" payment."
"def-terms","Terms refers to a arrangement where instead of paying all cash upfront, we make regular payments to you over time. This often allows us to pay you more overall while giving you consistent income. We can structure these terms to fit your specific needs, whether that's monthly payments, a larger down payment, or a specific payoff timeline."
