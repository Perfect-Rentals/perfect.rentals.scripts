"concern-default","For term agreements, we create what's called a \"mortgage wrap\" contract. That is a contract between us and you that says that if we fail to pay the mortgage, then you can take the property back from us. However, we've never had a late payment or a missed payment. In fact, we pay the mortgage company directly. We make sure that we pay using automated payments so that it automatically comes out of the account. We mostly pay 10 days before the due date just in case there's any issue with technology."
"concern-house-damage","We carry landlord insurance that will cover damages to the property and names your lender as \"additional insured\". In addition, we require that tenants carry renters insurance in an amount that is at least the amount owed to you. If there is a claim event then the property will be repaired accordingly to retain or improve its value."
"concern-tenant-damage","We do not want this anymore than you do, so, we screen our tenants very thoroughly and very rigorously. Put yourself in our shoes: do you want to get calls at 3 AM on a Sunday or calls from the local sheriff?"
"concern-fail-to-pay","First, we do not want to lose money. If we fail to pay you, then we'll lose the house and all the money we've invested in it. Second, as part of the agreement, we'll put a \"mortgage wrap\" contract in place to protect us both. The property will be returned to you by executing a \"deed in lieu of foreclosure.\""
"concern-close","We can close as quickly as you want to. If you want to leave quickly, in general, it takes one month to close. The standard purchase and sale agreement contract has a 21 day due diligence period where we will have the property inspected and make sure everything is ready for close. If we continue with the purchase, that means we schedule a closing and that depends on how quickly the title company can get us booked. When would you like to close?"
