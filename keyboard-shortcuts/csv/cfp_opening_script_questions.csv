"osq10-terms","Let me explain how we can make this process incredibly simple and beneficial for you. We often buy homes by taking over existing payments or creating a payment plan that works for you. This means you get more money over time, without any hassle or fees â€“ and we handle everything, so you don't have to lift a finger. You walk away with more cash in your pocket, no closing costs, and we take care of all the repairs and expenses. Would something like this work for you?"
"osq10-terms-yes","Fantastic! Let's schedule a quick call to go over the next steps. I'll handle everything, and you'll see how easy this process can be."
"osq10-cash-fixer","I understand that you're looking for a cash option. Since the house needs some repairs, we could explore an all-cash offer that allows you to sell quickly without making any fixes. If we were to pay all cash and close when you want, what's the least you would take for the property?"
"osq10-cash-turnkey","I understand that you're looking for a cash offer at full market value. Just so you know, when we pay cash, it's typically because the property needs a lot of work, and we're getting it at a discount. Since your home is in great condition, our seller finance option allows us to pay much more. This means you walk away with more money and avoid all the typical hassles. If cash at retail is your only option, you might be better off listing with a real estate agent to get that full market value. Would you be open to discussing how we could make this work on terms that might actually benefit you more?"
