| `osq10-terms`        | Let me explain how we can make this process incredibly simple and beneficial for you. We often buy homes by taking over existing payments or creating a payment plan that works for you. This means you get more money over time, without any hassle or fees â€“ and we handle everything, so you don't have to lift a finger. You walk away with more cash in your pocket, no closing costs, and we take care of all the repairs and expenses. Would something like this work for you?                                                                                                                                       |
| `osq10-terms-yes`    | Fantastic! Let's schedule a quick call to go over the next steps. I'll handle everything, and you'll see how easy this process can be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `osq10-cash-fixer`   | I understand that you're looking for a cash option. Since the house needs some repairs, we could explore an all-cash offer that allows you to sell quickly without making any fixes. If we were to pay all cash and close when you want, what's the least you would take for the property?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `osq10-cash-turnkey` | I understand that you're looking for a cash offer at full market value. Just so you know, when we pay cash, it's typically because the property needs a lot of work, and we're getting it at a discount. Since your home is in great condition, our seller finance option allows us to pay much more. This means you walk away with more money and avoid all the typical hassles. If cash at retail is your only option, you might be better off listing with a real estate agent to get that full market value. Would you be open to discussing how we could make this work on terms that might actually benefit you more? |

That monthly payment is going to go towards the balance of what I owe you, okay?                                                                                                                                                             |
| `csq7`   | Does all of that make sense? If I buy your house at the [price] with [down payment] down and make the monthly payment of [monthly payment] does all of this work for you?                                                                                                                                                              |

| `when-default`       | For term agreements, we create what's called a "mortgage wrap" contract. That is a contract between us and you that says that if we fail to pay the mortgage, then you can take the property back from us. However, we've never had a late payment or a missed payment. In fact, we pay the mortgage company directly. We make sure that we pay using automated payments so that it automatically comes out of the account. We mostly pay 10 days before the due date just in case there's any issue with technology. |
| `when-house-damage`  | We carry landlord insurance that will cover damages to the property and names your lender as "additional insured". In addition, we require that tenants carry renters insurance in an amount that is at least the amount owed to you. If there is a claim event then the property will be repaired accordingly to retain or improve its value.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `when-tenant-damage` | We do not want this anymore than you do, so, we screen our tenants very thoroughly and very rigorously. Put yourself in our shoes: do you want to get calls at 3 AM on a Sunday or calls from the local sheriff?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `when-fail-to-pay`   | First, we do not want to lose money. If we fail to pay you, then we'll lose the house and all the money we've invested in it. Second, as part of the agreement, we'll put a "mortgage wrap" contract in place to protect us both. The property will be returned to you by executing a "deed in lieu of foreclosure."                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `when-close`         | We can close as quickly as you want to. If you want to leave quickly, in general, it takes one month to close. The standard purchase and sale agreement contract has a 21 day due diligence period where we will have the property inspected and make sure everything is ready for close. If we continue with the purchase, that means we schedule a closing and that depends on how quickly the title company can get us booked. When would you like to close?                                                       |

| `ask-attorney`     | Yes, When do you think you'll be able to get this to your attorney? Lets set up a call. Be sure to ask your attorney "When can they review it?", and "When can they get back to you?"                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `def-balloon`      | On or before the end of the agreed upon term, we'll pay you the remainder of what is owed on the property in a single "balloon" payment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `def-terms`        | Terms refers to a arrangement where instead of paying all cash upfront, we make regular payments to you over time. This often allows us to pay you more overall while giving you consistent income. We can structure these terms to fit your specific needs, whether that's monthly payments, a larger down payment, or a specific payoff timeline.      |
| `send-email-offer` | I'd love to do that; unfortunately it's company policy that we can't just leave open offers floating out there. We are looking at dozens of houses every day. Therefore, I am required to send you the written offer and review it TOGETHER to make sure that I can answer all of your questions and make sure you are 100% comfortable with everything. |
